I have generated two outliers labeled spreadsheet 
1. Percentage of outlier = 5% : OutlierPoints_Processed_Month_C_0.05.xlsx
2. Percentage of outlier = 10% : OutlierPoints_Processed_Month_C_0.1.xlsx
Also, another spreadsheet (Correlation Matrix.xlsx) generated for visualizing correlations between econ indices ad farming production data.
